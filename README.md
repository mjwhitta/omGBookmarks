## What is this?

This is a simple project that would allow me to keep my bookmarks in a
browser independent location. The [Chrome extension] works fairly
well. The Firefox extension was left in an unknown state after I
discovered the extension publishing process to be more involved.

### Known issues

Ensure all your bookmarks have a label applied to them.
